## Create Facade

To create a facade for the route class we have [Command Options](/en/1.0.0/options) to generate and add the route class on `aliases`. Learn more about [Facade](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/facades#introduction) on the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/).

To generate run this command:
```bash
php artisan make:route Auth --aliases=AuthRoute --facade
```

After create the route class and added to alias if we look at on the `config/app.php`

and look for `AuthRoute` the facade was automatically added.  

```php
 /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Class Aliases
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This array of class aliases will be registered when this application
    | is started. However, feel free to register as many as you wish as
    | the aliases are "lazy" loaded so they don't hinder performance.
    |
    */

    'aliases' => [
        'AuthRoute' => App\Routes\Facades\Auth::class,
        .....
```

if we go to `App\Routes\Facades\Auth::class` we can see the facade that generated by the package.

```php
<?php 

namespace App\Routes\Facades;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade;

Class Auth extends Facade
{
	protected static function getFacadeAccessor()
    {
        return 'AuthRoute';
    }
}
```

<b>Note:</b> if you not set the `--aliases=<name>` the alias name will return to the route class name automatically and we can all it using `RouteClass::routes()`, Sometimes the `alias name` name is already use on the aliases like `auth` incase the facade is not working you need to set a `unique` alias name like `AuthRoute` and clear the cache.

```php
//routes/web.php
AuthRoute::routes();
```
